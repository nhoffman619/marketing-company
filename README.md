# Marketing-Company

## Description 
This project aimed to fulfill the accessibility standards of a Marketing Website. The reason this was done was to maximize search engines results for the webpage. This was done by refactoring source code to include `<alt>` features while also in attempt to leave the code cleaner. By doing so the webpage will be accessible to everyone, which in return will cause it to be higher on search engine results. As a result the HTML and CSS pages formats were edited to increase better flow and decrease clutter. 

## Usage 
By reviewing the source code it clear to see `<alt>` feature was needed in all img and link commands.
